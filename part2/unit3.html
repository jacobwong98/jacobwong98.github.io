        <h1><u>Unit Three: XML &amp; Ajax</u></h1>
        <a href="#quizStart">Go to Quiz</a>
        <p>
            In Unit One, we looked at how we can use HTML to determine the structure/content of webpages
            using markup language (i.e. elements provided like p, span, b, etc).<br />With Extensible Markup Language (XML)
            , it allows us to create our own markup languages to represent any kind of information. For example
            <xmp class="center" style="display:block">
                <book>
                    <title>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</title>
                    <author>J.K Rowling</author>
                </book>
            </xmp>
        </p>
        <p>
            XML can also allow attributes just like HTML inside the tags that help add information about the tags.
            In the above example I could add the attribute bookNum="7" within the title tag and this would show that the Deathly Hallows
            was the 7<sup>th</sup> book of the series.
        </p>
        <h4>Some basic rules/practices for XML</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Should use the XML declaration to identify an XML document and its version of syntax (optional)</li>
            <li>Elements must had start and end tags &amp; element names must start with letter/underscore and xml</li>
            <li>Adding whitespace in the element name is an error</li>
            <li>Necessary to have a root element that encompasses all other elements</li>
            <li>
                <label>Namespaces</label> helps prevent issues differentiating elements when
                they have the same element name. For example,
                <xmp class="center" style="display:block;">
                    <hockey:player>Wayne Gretsky</hockey:player>
                    <basketball:player>Michael Jordan</basketball:player>
                </xmp>
                allows the XML parser to know that the first element is a player in hockey while the later is a player in basketball
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>DTDs and Schemas</h2>
        <p>
            Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and schemas specify
            the element type/attributes and relationships to one another in an XML document.<br />
            This helps the XML parser to verify that a XML document is valid (could be structured properly but is not valid).<br />
            DTD expresses rules for document structure using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammar. The issue with DTD is that it
            can not describe the element or attribute's data type.
        </p>
        <p>
            XML Schemas don't use EBNF grammar however they are able to specify the type of data an element can contain.
            Much like DTDs, XML documents that conforms the schema is considered to be valid.<br />
            With schemas, we can have two types of elements: <strong>Simple</strong> &amp; <strong>Complex</strong>
            where one can't contain child elements and defines restrictions on schema-type or user-defined type.
            Whereas, complex types can have attributes/child elements where the child elements can be simple or complext types.
        </p>
        <p>
            So now our XML is valid but when you open your XML in a browser it still displays the same structure that is shown
            in a text editor. Let's find out how to make your XML styled how you want on the browser.
        </p>
        <h2>Extensible Stylesheet Language</h2>
        <p>
            Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) can be used to convert XML into a text-based document (i.e. into content that can be displayed in the browser).
            Much like CSS, we can apply an XSL rules save in a .xsl file to an XML document like this:<xmp style="display:block;" class="center">
                <?xml -stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="resume.xsl" ?>
            </xmp>
        </p>
        <p>Here is what goes in the file to do what we want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>/</strong> character - Selects the document root (one of the reasons that we need a root element in XML)</li>
            <li><strong>XSL element value-of</strong> - Gets an attribute's value</li>
            <li><strong>match=""</strong> - Selects depending on what is in the double quotes (can be elementName, a path to an element, etc) </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ajax</h2>
        <p>
            Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) allows web applications to be more responsive using client-side scripting (JavaScript).
            How does it make them more responsive? Ajax separates client-side interaction and server communication by running them in parallel. This means when
            a request is sent to the server, the user can still interact with page without having the application to wait for the server to respond to the request.
        </p>
        <p>
            What Ajax does is use the <strong>XMLHTTPRequest object</strong> to handle the request/response from the server.
            Then when the server sends the response back, the XMLHTTPRequest object invokes a callback function that will
            update a portion of the page so that the entire page does not need to be reloaded. This callback function is registered as an event handler
            (readystatechange) for the XHR object and is called whenever the request makes progress. Here are the steps for making an XMLHTTPRequest
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an XMLHTTPRequest object</li>
            <li>Add readystatechange event listener to XHR object</li>
            <li>Use open method to initilize request with method (GET or POST) and URI</li>
            <li>Use send method to send the request to the server</li>
            <li>
                Within the function that will run on readystatechange, check for:
                <ul>
                    <li>readyState == 4 (Request is complete)</li>
                    <li>status == 200 (Server successfully returned response)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Can then use responseText or responseXML to get the content requested depending on what you are requesting</li>
        </ol>
